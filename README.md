ArduinoMegaChess II
===================

This repository contains my modifications to the source code found at https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Sergey_Urusov/arduino-mega-chess-ii-b2e599.

* fixed a couple of typos as outlined in comments at https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Sergey_Urusov/arduino-mega-chess-ii-b2e599
* changed `gui.h` for Kuman 3.5" TFT LCD shield, as suggested in comments
* Returned sound effects from earlier version (https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Sergey_Urusov/arduino-mega-chess-d54383)
* Change rotate button to image from earlier version and add sound toggle button, also with image from earlier version (*I've guessed at the size and position changes for the smaller LCD layout -- I don't have the specific Adafruit TFT to test against*)
